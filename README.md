# NeverEver ðŸ‘‰

## Background
Small afternoon project, after being frustrated with the low quality of questions in the free apps built for the Swedish drinking game "Pekleken" I decided to build my own web version. For simplicity's sake the application uses Google sheets as the backend so that the admin can simply share a link and let people add their own questions. 

Since the app only displays a set of phrases either sequentially or randomly it can probably support various games and use cases other then the intended one. Make it your own! 

The application is a little crappy and very hastily made, the goal was to finish it in a single afternoon
